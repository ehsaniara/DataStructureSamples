/**
 * Created by Ehsaniara (Jay.Ara) on 9/12/17.
 * From https://www.ehsaniara.com
 * Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head nodes of two sorted linked lists. The data in both lists will be sorted in ascending order. Change the next pointers to obtain a single, merged linked list which also has data in ascending order. Either head pointer given may be null meaning that the corresponding list is empty.
 * <p>
 * Input Format
 * You have to complete the Node* MergeLists(Node* headA, Node* headB) method which takes two arguments - the heads of the two sorted linked lists to merge. You should NOT read any input from stdin/console.
 * <p>
 * Output Format
 * Change the next pointer of individual nodes so that nodes from both lists are merged into a single list. Then return the head of this merged list. Do NOT print anything to stdout/console.
